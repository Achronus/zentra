# Zentra API

_Note: still in development_

A CLI tool for building [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) projects faster.

Read more about the Zentra stack on [GitHub](https://github.com/Achronus/zentra).

To get started, install the package with:

```bash
pip install zentra_api
```

Then create a new project with:

```bash
zentra-api init <project_name>
```

With one command you'll have a working app in minutes with:

- Built-in user authentication with JWT token protection
- Preconfigured CORs middleware
- A [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database configured with [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/)
- Built-in templated route responses following best practices
- And, a simple folder structure to make project navigation a breeze

Read more about it in our [documentation](#) (_WIP_).
