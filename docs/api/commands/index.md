# CLI Commands

This section focuses on the command line interface (CLI) commands you can use with the [`zentra-api`](../../api/index.md) package.

Like the tutorial series, we've divided this section into separate pages to make things easier to navigate. You can access the commands using the navigation menu on the left or select a command from the list below.

!!! tip "Help Flag"
    All commands are configured with a `--help` flag that provides you with extra information about them. Simply add it to the command to read more information about it. For example:

    ```shell title=""
    zentra-api init --help
    ```

## Available Commands

- [init](../../api/commands/init.md)
- [add-route](../../api/commands/add-route.md)
- [new-key](../../api/commands/new-key.md)
