# Help

This chapter focuses on steps you can take when encountering errors when using one of [`Zentra's`](#) command-line interfaces (CLIs) or SDKs.

We've tried to design the error messages to provide you with useful feedback so you can debug and fix most problems yourself.

We know how frustrating errors can be and want to help you focus on programming your project with minimal interference. However, we cannot account for everything.

If you need additional information on an error message, we recommend you refer to our [Error Handling Guide](errors/index.md) first.

If it's unable to help, we encourage you to follow our [Reporting Issues Guide](report.md).
