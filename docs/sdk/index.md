# Zentra SDK

The SDK is the easiest way to get a full-stack application up and running in minutes. 

It includes the API and Models packages for the [FastAPI [:material-arrow-right-bottom:]](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) backend and builds the [Next.js [:material-arrow-right-bottom:]](https://nextjs.org/) frontend automatically too.

!!! info "Important"

    The Zentra SDK requires you to have the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed to create the frontend files. Please make sure you have Docker running first before using the package.

To get started, install the [`zentra-sdk`](#) package with [Poetry [:material-arrow-right-bottom:]](https://python-poetry.org/) through [PIP [:material-arrow-right-bottom:]](https://pypi.org/project/zentra-sdk/):

```cmd title=""
pip install zentra-sdk poetry
```
