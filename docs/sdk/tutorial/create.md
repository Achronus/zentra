# Creating a Project

Using the SDK is the easiest method for getting started with a new project.

Simply run the [`init`](../commands/init.md) command and you'll have a [FastAPI [:material-arrow-right-bottom:]](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) backend and [Next.js [:material-arrow-right-bottom:]](https://nextjs.org/) frontend in seconds! No extra parameters needed.

```cmd title=""
zentra init
```

You'll find two new shiny directories in your project folder that will look similar to this:

```cmd title=""
<project_name>/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ alembic.ini
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .env.local
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ env/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Backend Directory

??? question "Did you know?"

    We built the backend using the [`zentra-api`](../../api/index.md) package! 
    ```cmd title=""
    zentra-api init backend
    ```

    Pretty cool right?! ðŸ¤“

The backend directory is home to our [FastAPI [:material-arrow-right-bottom:]](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) files and is fully managed by the [`zentra-api`](../../api/index.md) package.

You can read more about it in the API [First Steps](../../api/tutorial/first-steps.md) tutorial.

## Frontend Directory

The frontend directory contains our [Next.js [:material-arrow-right-bottom:]](https://nextjs.org/) files and is unique to the SDK package.

We'll read more about this in the next chapter, but for now, we should probably finish setting up the frontend!ðŸ˜…

## Starting The Frontend

1. Firstly, access the frontend directory:

    ```cmd title=""
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Next, install the Node packages:

    ```shell title=""
    npm install
    ```

3. Test it works by running the development environment:

    ```shell title=""
    npm run dev
    ```

4. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see the following:

If so, you are good to go! ðŸš€
