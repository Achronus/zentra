# Getting Started

Zentra is a powerful tool that can help speed up your workflow and make development a breeze. Using it's CLI, you can quickly put together a brand new project in minutes and expand on it with minimal effort.

## What's Included?

Zentra SDK is divided into two packages:

- [API](/api) - a CLI tool for building [FastAPI [:material-arrow-right-bottom:]](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) applications
- [Models](/models) - a Python based component library, turning [Pydantic [:material-arrow-right-bottom:]](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) models into React components

Each package works independently so you can maximise their benefits with ease.

Perhaps you only want to build a FastAPI project, or simply want to build React components using Python - you choose what is right for you.
